# Welcome to the Operating Manual for Tango!

[Explore the Tango Learning Missions](v1/index.md) in Version 1 of the Manual

This open-sourced, collaboratively edited beginner curriculum is designed to provide structure for the first several hours of a learning for someone learning tango for the first time. Depending on the person, it could be explored in 20-60 hours. 

The intent is to support tango community organizers in smaller communities, and tango university clubs, by providing an easy-to-use curriculum including videos that intermediate and advanced dancers can use to integrate newcomers to tango. 

The ultimate hope is that this becomes a part of an ecosystem of tools that support the growth of community through social, improvised tango.

## Basic language
* RING - A tango level. Each ring is a different color and has a different theme. 
* MISSION - A mission is a unit of nano-learning with a specific learning outcome. Missions that teach new movement material have this [anatomy](http://tangomanual.com/v1/appendix/anatomy-of-a-mission)
* ZONE - A zone is a set of technique drills, exercises or practice games that you are never really "done" with.

## Our values

We seek to model and expand values that support connection, including: 

* Honoring intergenerational learning
* Celebrating improvisation and the experience of social tango for its own sake
* Supporting the teachers who have made all that we cherish possible by buying their instructional offerings
* Supporting living, in-person community and the organizers who facilitate these experiences
* Supporting tango music and the musicians who create it by buying music
* Celebrating the contributions of all those we've learn from, telling their stories
* Working to create an ever-more safe, comfortable and equitable experience for everyone
* Grounding our communication nonviolently in [feelings] (https://www.cnvc.org/sites/default/files/feelings_inventory_0.pdf) and [needs,] (https://www.cnvc.org/sites/default/files/needs_inventory_0.pdf) instead of judgements and demands
* Remembering appreciation and expanding lovingkindness to self and to all
* Spreading the message of our essential interdependence in tango and tango learning
