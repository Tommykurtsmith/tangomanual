# Follow the Follower #

* In practice hold, follower pivots and extends either forwards OR backwards pivot after shared side step (follower's choice!) 
* Leader Follows the Follower and accompanies her chosen ocho
* Alternate with ochos in which the leader invites forward vs backwards
* Add option of leader contradicting ocho direction chosen by follower
* Exchange about how the Yin/Yang grid relates to lead/follow off the dance floor

Role | Upper Body | Lower Body
--- | --- | ---
Leader's | Yang | Yin
Follower's | Yin | Yang

Credit: Idea of grid articulating difference in receptivity between leader's and follower's upper and lower bodies came from [Sharna Fabiano](http://www.sharnafabiano.com/)
