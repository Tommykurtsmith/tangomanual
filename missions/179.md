# Which Part of the Foot? #

* The follower places weight, but now focussing on a particular part of the foot (heel, ankle, ball of the foot, toes)
* The leader reports what he feels
* Follower confirms/corrects
* Further: The leader moves the followers axis with the footprint, looking for the “sweet spot” follower says “now” when her weight is comfortably over the ball of foot.
