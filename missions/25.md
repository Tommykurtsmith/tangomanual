## Description

Switch between inline steps and weight changes

### Steps

1. Practice hold, leader's left, follower's right. 
2. Invite/extend, inline advancing step, full shared weight change, inline retreat. 
3. Progress to chest to chest
4. Progress to close embrace
5. Do it right after the cross.

### Bonus!

Tons of variations on this one!

* Try the other side: starting on hugward side
* Change the size: advancing bigger, retreating smaller
* Play with rhythm - hardest but soo good! Mmm syncopation!
* Instead of advance/retreat, try 2x advance
* Try 2x retreat - deal with navigation puzzle! 
* Make one of the steps outside-partner instead of inline
