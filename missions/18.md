## Description

Zigzagging down line of dance together

### Steps

1. Lead advancing outside-partner step (third step in Box)
2. Lead weight change
3. Lead side step (top of the Box)
4. Lead weight change
5. Repeat

### Tips

* Slow down and focus on each weight change, make sure these are being fully communicated
* When stepping side, the leader should land with weight a little forward

### Bonus!

* *Simon Says Game 1!* Follower calls out "Box" or "Stair" and leader needs to switch to the new patter with the very next step. 
* *Simon Says Game 2!* Pick threee missions in the Milonga ring. Follower calls out which one to do and the leader leads it next.
