# Which Foot? #

* The follower changes weight a few times quickly, and then choses a standing side and builds her axis clearly there
* The leader feels in which legs she is standing and taps the corresponding shoulder
* The follower reports: yes or no
* Repeat (goal 5 out 5 correct)
* Further options: Instead of tapping the shoulder the leader offers to lead a step based on his knowledge/belief of where the follower is standing.  For beginners this works well as side step.  For intermediate a back ocho or sandwich
