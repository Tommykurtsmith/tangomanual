# Empathy Session #

* Set a 3-minute timer for speaker to speak and listener to listen
* Find touch that feels comfortable (such as touching hands) 
* During the session: 
  * While speaking, refer to partner in 3rd person if you need to refer to them 
  * While listening, focus on generating protective kindness toward speaker  
* When timer goes off, listener asks 3 questions about physical environment (e.g., "how many pairs of shoes are under that chair?")
