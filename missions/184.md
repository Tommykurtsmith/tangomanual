# Festival Empathy #

* imagine the upcoming event through the eyes, shoes, heart of someone who has a different tango-identity than you (e.g., lead, follow, true switch, teacher, organizer)
* imagine: 
  * what they are looking forward towhat stresses them out
  * what little or large challenges they are anticipating, or little worries
  * what strategies or hopes they have
  * what would be supporting or helpful
* form an intention of how you might support that other group
