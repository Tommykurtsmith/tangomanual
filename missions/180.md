# Which Direction? #

* Each practices alone the process of sending the free leg in projection with a counter pressure against the floor in the standing side.
* In the embrace, the follower prepares a direction (of their own choosing)
* Leader reports the direction that he feels
* Repeat with eyes closed
* Further: 
  * Leader invites/accompanies a step in the perceived direction (the direction they believe the follower is preparing)
  * Leader invites the step as above but instead of accompanying, he makes a sacada
