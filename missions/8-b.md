## Description

For expressive following and perceptive leadingâ€¦there are four different parts to this: 

* **Guess:** Decide on a few elements both people know, name them. E.g., The Cross, the Parada, the Forward Ocho. For one song, the follower tries to show which she enjoys most - the leader tries to guess!
* **Exaggerate:** The follower exagerrates the leader's step size, dancing big steps bigger and small steps smaller. One song. 
* **Match:** The leader leads only walking to the cross. The follower decides on step size (tiny, small, medium, huge) and the leader matches. One song. 
* **The Free Leg:** For one song, the leader leads anything and the both focus on drawing attention to the follower's lower body - hips, legs, feet. Slow mo is great!
