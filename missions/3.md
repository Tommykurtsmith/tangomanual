## Description

Synchronized walking side-by-side.

### Steps

1. Walk side by side, arms around backs
2. Play with double time, half time and pauses
3. Switch the lead

Builds on natural instinctual ability to walk through a space, lead and follow, which people usually lose when they are put into a formal dance situation.

### Tips

* You don't need to start on the same leg
* The idea is to take the same size steps at the same time
* Pausing (staying on one foot) vs weight shifts (marching in place) 

### Bonus! 

* Play with a few really long pauses
* Tell them about the line of dance
