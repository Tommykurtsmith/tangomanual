# Turning System Awareness #

* In a tango embrace, the follower practices the turning system steps around the leader.  (this is unled, the follower can chance the turn direction or speed in any moment)
* The leader reports which type of step she is making in each moment (back, side, forwards)
* Repeat with the leaderâ€™s eyes closed
* Further:
  * Leader can make a light contact between his free foot and the new standing leg of the follower to confirm her location
  * Leader locates her front step and leads a parada with direction change, follower passes in the new direction and continues to practice.
