Imaginary difficult-to-hear messages:
* Why are you leading it like THAT ?
* So, why did you want to start learning Tango in the first place ?
* This isn’t working. (Dramatic sigh.)
* (The dancing itself becomes uncooperative.)
* ACTually, could you lead it corectly so I can focus on what I’m trying to work on?
* Hmm, well maybe you should take private lessons with him if you don’t know how to do THAT.
* Fine, then why don’t you practice with HER then ?
* How am I supposed to...?

* You want to try leading THAT?
* You want to try LEADING that?
* We’re never going to get this in time for the performance.
* I don’t care. (Shrug.)
* I don’t know. (Shrug.)
* I’m really worried about this performance.
* Maybe you should just...(fix your left hand, dance better, listen to the music...)
