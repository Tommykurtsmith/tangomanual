# Mirror Interview #

## What should we talk about? This provides a simple structure where everyone gets to ask, and be asked, whatever they want! ## 

* Brainstorm your questions. You can look at your partner's profile and intro post on the forum for ideas! 
  * What are questions you'd like to ask your partner
  * What are questions you'd like your partner to ask you
* Can write and send their lists in advance. Option to use grid like this if helpful.
* Choose who goes first. They choose any question from the list of questions posed to them (by either person) and answer it. 
* Switch.
