## More Detail

The movement has the effect of changing a Backward Ocho into a Forward Ocho.  

### Variations

### Steps

1. Lead Backwards Ochos
2. Lead the Parada to the hugward side. 
3. Talk them through the parts: 
4. Leader stops the ocho (Parada) 
5. Leader Sandwiches
6. Leader Steps back
7. Follower Sandwiches
8. Follower steps over (Pasada)
9. Forward Ochos and exit

### Tips

* Explain that if feet touch we stop.

* Follower chooses the timing for when to step over.  
* For both to be comfortable and Aligned, the embrace needs to be very flexible. Explore when and where to adjust the arms.
