# Emotions #

* Dance 3 songs with a partner
* Write down feelings guided by [Plutchik's Wheel Of Emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrasting_and_categorization_of_emotions#/media/File:Plutchik-wheel.svg)
* Sort what's written into emotions vs. interpretations, judgments, or narratives
* Write five phrases that express appreciation without judgment
  * e.g. "I feel calm when we dance together" vs "You are a great dancer"
* Exchange appreciations
* Practice check-in/check-out protocol by saying feeling in the moment
