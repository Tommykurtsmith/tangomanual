# Invite Practice Partner #

* Re-read things you've written about partnership
* Make a list of people you've practiced with
* Ask a friend who they think you'd practice productively with, add to list
* Write a star next to the names of people you particulary resonate with
* List things you are curious about relating to each partner
* Write down feelings and needs relating to you and your prospective partner
* Craft request, e.g., "Would you be my partner for the recital on X day and practice with me at least two times to prepare?" 
* Decide when, where and how you plan extend your request - in-person, not rushed, 1:1
* Write down what you have learned in this process
