## Checklist

* Wall: Pivot! before step
* Far/near side invitation

## More Detail

The purpose is to help them find flow, ease and freedom with the Forward Ocho movement. 

### Steps

1. Demonstrate the Forward Ocho at the wall
2. Have them copy you
3. Explain the parts of the ocho: Extend, Step, Pivot, Extend
4. Repeat Forward Ochos in practice hold
5. Execute Forward Ochos from the Cross.
6. Learn exiting Forward Ochos to a side step

### Tips

* Be sure they PIVOT FULLY before reaching to the next step
* Highlight: The follower's part takes longer than the leader's part
* Highlight: The far side of the follower becomes the near side
* Explain leader's invitation: the embrace "talks" to one side of the follower's body to invite an ocho
* When they lead, let them problem-solve how to exit the ocho.

### Variations
* Tuck adornment before pivot
* Cross adornment before extension
