## Description

Big juicy relaxing steps for contrast

### Steps

1. Lead the first step of the Box, which is the first "forward" for the follower
2. Lead the follower forward again, this time outside-partner
3. Lead a side step hugward, turning a quarter turn
4. Lead a weight change
5. Repeat

### Tips

* Point out that walking forward is nice contrast for followers, since they mostly walk backwards
* Remind them to land heels-first when walking forward
* Lead first two steps BIG and keep LOW; last two steps UP and SMALL
* To make room for follower's second forward step outside-partner, leader's first step should be like on a tightrope

### Bonus! 

* When they lead, have them figure out how to start to it navigates (Answer: Start backwards!)
