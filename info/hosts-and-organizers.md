# Information for Hosts and Organizers


## This is the role of hosts and organizers 

### During a lab

* To present the system to the group and explain its purpose
* To explain "protocol check" so all dancers feel free to remind partners about technique
* To teach the most experienced dancers
* To ensure and facilitate productive pairings/groupings for each shift
* To be available for those who have questions, e.g., make sure people know they can interrupt you even if you're teaching

Here is a sample statement to explain the system to the group: 

"The purpose of this is so you're always working on something relevant to you. It lets you solidify your understanding by teaching. The assumption is that you KNOW something once you can teach it. In a shift, you and your partner can work on just the suggested mission, or multiple missions, or you can go back to previous missions. You can move as quickly or as slowly through the missions as you want. Anybody, including you, can sign off on your completing the missions. Whoever signs off that you have LEARNED the missions believes that you can follow and lead it. Whoever signs off that you can TEACH the missions would feel comfortable having you teach it to a new guest." 

### In the community in general

* To provide feedback about how to improve specific missions
* To provide feedback for evolving the system in general
* To check and verify people's understanding of missions they feel they have learned and can teach
* To facilitate demos and celebrations of skills acquired and milestones achieved
* To develop more qualified hosts/facilitators
* To champion the system in the community
* To champion a safe community
