&nbsp; |Not Competent|Competent
Alignment| Tilting, off-balance| Standing straight, balanced, feet underneath you
Frontality| Offset or unpredictable spacing| Continuous facing from hips up, hold partner in front of you
Stillness| Moving all the time| Able to wait, pause for as many as 8 beats
Leader’s Intention| Moves without inviting follower first |Invites follower to extend, before moving
Extension| Moves whole body at once| Uses base leg to stretch free leg, before committing weight
Following, vs. Guessing| Mentally guessing where to be and what to do| Kinaesthetically feeling what’s needed to stay with leader
Follower’s Power| Moving passively, timidly, or without energy; overly small steps| Making decisive, active steps once committed - moving with conviction
Follow the Follower| Leader steps to a pre-determined location| Steps to a place that factors in follower’s interpretation of lead
Floorcraft| Unable to manage couple’s location in space/in relation to other couples| Able to advance in a single lane without passing, bumping, or stalling others
The Pivot Before The Step| Incomplete pivots, extra pivots, stepping before pivot is completed, pivoting without balance, pivoting with legs apart| A balanced pivot with legs together that prepares lower body for step
Quality of Embrace| Tense arms, arms press down, gripping with hands, slack hands| Arms and hands are light, supporting presence that is comfortable for partner
Downbeat and QQS | Moving without reference to music| Steps generally land on the downbeat, and QQS in double-times
