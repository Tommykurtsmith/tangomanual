## Description

How we hold each other with respect and safety

### Steps

Warm up: Improvise without any touch/embrace at all. Switch roles. 

1. Stand in front of each other, hips facing hips. The follower sets the distance
2. Follower holds leader's arm, back or shoulders with left side, and leader encircles followers' body around ribcage.  
3. Leader offers left hand, follower takes it, leader encloses hand
4. Focus on breath, standing tall, sensing points of contact and making whatever adjustments are needed to be comfortable, for 5 breaths
5. Do it again trying a slightly different distance
6. Switch roles

### Tips

* Avoid eye gazing, it can feel weird. Follower's focus is leader's shirt, leader's hold soft focus taking in space around couple
* Leader's right arm should land in a neutral respectful place, about the level of the bra strap. 
* On handward side, make sure follower's right arm is comfortable, not squished. Helps if leader's arm is in plane of his own body. 
* Emphasize importance of comfort and adapting to different bodies.
* Everyone remember to stand tall! Align feet, hips, ribcage, head
* Think of the embrace is a process of exploring comfort in intimacy â€” not a frozen shape.

### Bonus!

* Breath Sync Game! Inhale on pauses, exhale on steps.
* Weight Game: Dance. When follower's left arm feels heavy to lead, leader raises left arm!
* Explore how asymmetry of embrace makes some moves easier
* Ask if they have questions and discuss!
