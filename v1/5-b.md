## Description

The best way to the cross in close embrace

### Steps

1. Do crossed salida (from "The Other System" mission) slowly in practice hold. 
2. Do secret weight change on double-time
3. Once that's working, lead follower's cross on double-time
4. Now lead with on-the-body contact (no arms) with continuous tone
5. Add arms/embrace
6. Switch roles

### Tips

* When first doing it on-the-body, calibrate to 7-8
* Helps if leader makes two BIG CLEAR BRAVE steps Left, Right to the cross. (Tendency to swallow the 2nd step)
* Have leader say "cross" and pause when they feel the follower cross. 

### Bonus!

* Graft it onto the end of Rock-Step-Open, using side step of Rock-Step-Open as 1st step of Crossed Salida
* Explain why it's preferred way of going to cross in close embrace (easier to stay close)
