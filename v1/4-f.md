## Description

Challenging game to develop sensitivity and subtlety in sharing more unusual extensions

### Steps

1. Explain clock face: follower's standing leg (left leg) is center
2. In practice embrace, lead 12 o'clock (back extension) vs 3 o'clock (side)
3. Now lead 2 o'clock, 1 o'clock
4. Switch legs, now lead 12 o'clock, 9 o'clock
5. Now 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock
6. Shake it out and switch roles

### Tips

* Works best if leader keeps weight evenly split comfy on both legs
* Talk about it when there's a difference between what leader intends and what follower perceives
* Be patient cuz this is really hard!

### Bonus! 

* Doing it in close embrace means even more precise and subtle! 
* Combine with Caminar mission
