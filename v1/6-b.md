## Description

Flowy way to turn big out of ochos. Lapiz is BONUS, nonessential! 

### Steps

1. Help them walk through follower's part: backwards ochos into back, side, forward. 
2. Lead them a few times, end with parada of forward step. 
3. Lead it in ping-pong-ball embrace
4. Inteleave with other elements.
5. Show the leader's inward pivot that sets up the turn.
6. They lead it a few times at normal speed
7. They lead with the embrace a few times
8. Interleave with other material once it's working well. 

### Tips

* Helps for follower's back-side-forward to be boxy, like a square horseshoe (vs "round") and to use her side step to get to other side of leader's body
* Have them lead ochos in slow motion and tell them exactly when to pivot inward for the turn
* Leader to support follower through big back pivot, support and give it time
* As follower lands in forward ocho, leader can lower - this inspires a pivot.

### Bonus!

* Try adding a lapiz during the follower's back-side-front
* Introduce the concept of laterality
