## Description

Things you need to notice - other than your partner

### Steps

1. Introduce counterclockwise line of dance with concentric lanes
2. Demonstrate entering the dance floor: eye contact with leader, enter in front
3. Have them practice: Enter floor, take embrace, lead the cross, then stop/exit and try again. 

### Tips

* Helps to think of dancing space as Monopoly board we travel counterclockwise
* Goal is to travel from one CORNER directly to another CORNER
* Leader's focus is FOLLOWING the couple in front

### Bonus! 

* Explain importance of eye contact and introduce cabeceo
* Talk about why it's easier to be in outer lane vs middle 
* Tango Train Game! Pick a leader to follow. Enter in front of them. Follow them for the rest of the song. Use pauses and rock steps to keep a buffer zone with no tailgating or passing.
