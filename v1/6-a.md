## Description

Intro to fancy-pants tango turns

### Steps

1. Explain follower's grapevine default
2. Help them walk through follower's part from cross in practice hold: forward, side, back, ending with parada/pasada
3. Lead a few times til it's smooth
4. Now with embrace: Start in close embrace, open to ping-pong-ball distance at the cross, lead the turn, return to close embrace
5. Have the do the swivelly leader's footwork solo
5. Help them talk through the leader's part of the turn, using a practice hold
6. After cross, as leader invites forward ocho, steps with left foot opposite direction to follower's forward step
7. As he leads side step, he swivels to find sacada with right
8. Switch feet to parada her back step 
9. Now have them lead it with the embrace described above

### Tips

* Most followers will want to do a second forward ocho, out of habit, instead of the grapevine turn. Help them pay closer, more detailed attention to the invitation as they make that first ocho...  
* Make sure they still lead the cross. Once they start focusing on turn, it can go out the window

### Bonus!

* In the original turn, find the parada with leader's the other (left) foot. What system is this? 
* Try the turn with leader's other foot (right, left). How do you get to the parada now?   
* Help them see how walking to the cross is a grapevine variant
