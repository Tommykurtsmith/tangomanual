## Description

Double time rhythm that adds energy and alertness

### Steps

1. Lead "testing the waters": sending weight halfway into a side step then returning
2. Lead a weight change in place
3. Lead a retreating inline step
4. Repeat, and this time do an advancing outside-partner step after the weight change

### Tips

* Slowly and clearly lead the weight change after the "testing the waters" - it is easily missed

### Bonus! 

* Define traspie: three steps instead of one in the same timing, resulting in a double-time
