## Description

An enjoyable compact turn for a small crowded dance floor

### Steps

1. Lead Crossed Salida practice hold. 
2. Lead it making it curl to the left. So cross ends up behind you
3. Do with on-the-body contact with continuous tone, no arms
4. Add embrace and repeat til it's pretty consistent
5. Lead half a song, interleaving with Crossed Salida
6. Help them lead it: in a practice hold, have them feel you (the follower) walk through it as they notice and name what you do
7. Have them lead it with a close embrace
8. Have them lead it, interleaving with Crossed Salida

### Tips

* The milonguero turn is just the follower curling the walk to the cross 
* Remember! Leader's footwork doesn't matter much, stay focused on follower's pattern
* When they lead, see what footwork they do naturally and help troubleshoot if legs in way
* Leader needs to do the same ribcage isolation as ocho cortado to get the cross

### Bonus!

* Figure out the transition that allows you to loop the turn (lead it over and over again)
* Interleave with Crossed Salida, Rock Step Open, Ocho Cortado and create your Milonguero Groove!
* Alternate entrance: Go to the cross, receive travelling forward ocho in crossed system, and rock it back, making this back step the first step of a gentle turn.
