## Description

Varation on easy box that travels down line of dance

### Steps

1. Lead the first four steps of the box (three sides of the box, minus the top)
2. Repeat, and travel down the line of dance
3. Occasionally, add the box-top anytime, to make sure communication is happening

### Tips

* The couple's handward side should be pointed down line of dance, so the Comb travels continuously downstream
