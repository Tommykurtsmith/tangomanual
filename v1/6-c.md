The first full turn is surprisingly easy

### Steps

2. Show how turning landing feet out in open step can help it really flow easily to americano ("fauxcho")
3. Help them walk through follower's part: full turn starts & ends with forward
4. Show how leader sacadas with right leg
5. Show how leader pivot-crosses inward to invite follow's back stepâ€¦
6. ...And keeps pivoting on new foot til walk out in americano with right

### Tips

* Remind follower to stay close to leader. (Side step tends to fall out of orbit)
* Remind leader to keep opening/inviting with left side of embrace.
