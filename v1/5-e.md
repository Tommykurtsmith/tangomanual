## Description

Comfortable unusual walk on closed side of the embrace

### Steps

1. In practice hold, show how it feels to follow when leader walks on closed side of embrace
2. Lead in close embrace
3. Help them see how it works as a leader in practice hold: 
-- Make a shared side step handward
-- Secret weight change for leader
-- Advance with free (left) leg on hugward ("dark") side 
-- Take one more step on dark side (leader's right leg), receiving backward ocho
-- Take next step on light side, receiving second backward ocho and continue to the cross
4. Have them lead it with on-the-body contact with continuous tone
5. Have them lead it, interleaving it with Tango Sentence. 

### Tips

* Remind them to let their spine spiral toward leader when following
* Helps if leader lands in side step with hips (and toes) angled inward direction toward dark side
* Helps if leaders side-step-setup is a bit smaller than follower's 
* Do it slowly in practice hold a lot of times. This move holds danger for follower's toes if rushed into close embrace

### Bonus!

* Explore why walking on dark side doesn't auto-cross (hint: embrace and line of dance!)
* Find a few different entrances into dark side walking
* Find a few more exits from dark side walking 
* Puzzle: Figure out how to get from Dark Side directly to Milonguero Turn!
