## Description

Making the leader's free leg pretty in the turn

### Steps

1. Have them walk through the follower's part: F, O, B, O, F handward 
2. Lead them in the turn a few times in practice hold
3. Lead them in it using as close of an embrace as you can
4. Interleave it with a few other turns for half a song
5. Have them practice the leader's new, weird pivot-back-tuck-pivot-lapiz thingy solo
6. Roughdraft the leader's part in practice hold: 
-- After follower's forward ocho, as she steps side, leader pivots left foot left and tucks right foot back behind left
-- Leader pivots on left front foot, with legs crossed tight, to show right side of body to follower
-- Leader transfers weight to right back foot as follower transitions from side to back
-- Lapiz with left during follower's back-side-forward
-- End with a parada of forward ocho
7. Have them lead it in a "real" embrace
8. Have them interleave it with other turning elements

### Tips

* Follower's focus: helping leader stay balanced
* Also helps if follower stays really active and helps the turn unfold by using each standing leg to "motorize" the turn

### Bonus!

* Find a different exit! Try multiple forward ochos. 
* Definions! lapiz: pencil. Usually lapices happen during follower's back-side-forward.
