## Description

Ultra-dynamic swirly finish for compact left turn

### Steps

1. Lead and follow the Milonguero Turn several times to review
2. Explain the Dip: follower's cross is replaced by forward step plus big pivot and final forward ocho
3. Lead the Dip slowly in practice hold ending with receiving forwards ocho
4. Lead it a few times in close embrace til it's working fluidly
5. Help them do leader's two-footed pivot: from open stance, pivots left on both feet & brings knees together
6. Give them specific leader's footwork: When follower steps side, leader extends side in opposite direction, then does two-footed pivot (that should cause her to pivot a lot upon full weight transfer)

### Tips

* It helps to lower after the follower's side step

### Bonus!

* Add two tap embellishment for follower: once before big pivot, once after
