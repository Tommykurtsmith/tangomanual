## Description

How to transition from being close to opening up

### Steps

1. Show opening the embrace on a backward ocho to parada
2. Show closing the embrace on a side step (leader comes to follower) 
3. Show another way of opening the embrace, at the cross (leader takes shorter step) 
4. Practice both these ways
5. Switch roles. 

### Tips

* The follower's arms need to be mobile and allow distance to change

### Bonus!

* Three Distances: Can you lead the difference between opening to basketball distance, baseball distance, vs ping-pong ball distance?
