## Description

The oldest move in the book that never gets old

### Steps

1. Help them do the follower's footwork solo til it's fluid
2. Take a practice hold and lead them in it
3. Do with on-the-body contact with continuous tone, no arms
4. Add embrace and repeat til it's pretty consistent
5. When leading, leader needs to clear legs out of space follower  wants to walk into. Have them figure out where to put legs.
6. Hold leader's hips while they practice turning ribcage to right, left. Sync this to follower's open, cross.

### Tips

* Highlight the weird inward-pivot of follower's right foot to the cross (It's the same cross, just coming from a side step not a back step)
* When first doing it on-the-body, calibrate to 7-8
* Leader's feet can stay very close to each other overall
* Watch out! If leader opens ribcage too much, follower turns too far
* Think of final step as a turning a little to leader's left

### Bonus!

* Tap the rhythm: 123 PAUSE 123. Try to dance it in this rhythm!
* Find a more linear version and also a more circular version.
* Can you lead the whole thing without leader moving feet??
