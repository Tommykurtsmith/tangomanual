## Description

Super useful rhythmic element for close embrace navigating  

### Steps

1. Lead it slowly in practice hold (Advance inline, retreat inline, shared side step, weight change)
2. Make it turn counterclockwise. How many will take you round 360Â°? 
3. Add double time rhythm
4. On-the-body contact but no arms, calibrate to #6 or what's comfortable and do the move
5. Add embrace
6. Switch roles, same progression (practice hold, add turning, add rhythm, on-the-body no arms, add embrace) 

### Tips

* Lower a little to communicate rock
* Don't transfer weight completely if you want to rock back
* Be sure you really share the final weight change, it's easy to miss

### Bonus!

* Add a LOOONG pause before final weight change
