## How to Bookmark the Tango Manual (and add it to your device home screen!)

Before you proceed, remember to [go back to the Manual Mission List page](v1/index.md)! Otherwise you'd end up bookmarking the page you're on right now.

### On iOS

1. Open the Tango Manual Mission List page Safari
2. Tap the little square icon with an arrow pointing up from it (that's "options" in apple icon language)
3. Tap the plus icon which says "Add to Home Screen"

### On Android

1. Open the Tango Manual Mission List page in Chrome
2. Open Chrome's menu
3. Tap the "Add to Home Screen" option
