# Operating Manual For Tango

## An Open Source Approach to Teaching Tango

## How to Contribute

### Found a typo or mistake? Have idea for a new mission?

#### Create a github issue.

GitHub issues is where people working on a project talk about specific issues and tasks. Here's [how to create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) (if you don't have a github account you'll be prompted to create one). 

Make sure you mention the mission number and be very specific. A good issue title would be "4-F: The steps in the description do not match the video." 

The description might say something like: "3. Leader turns to the right does not correspond to the video which shows the leader turning to the left."

Here's a link to the [Issues Page](https://github.com/andreimoment/tangomanual/issues) for this project.

### Want to suggest a mission rewrite? Or create a brand new mission? 

#### Fork the manual, rewrite the mission and create a pull request

Whoa, Neo, not everyone is a hacker. What is this forking and pulling stuff?

A *fork* is a special copy of a repository. It knows where it was copied from and when, and can tell the difference between its contents and the contents of the original. When you create your own fork/copy, you can add your changes to it, and you can send a special message to the owner of the original pointing out the changes you made and asking the owner to include them. That's the *pull request*.

Here are some GitHub's help pages: [About Forks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks/), [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
